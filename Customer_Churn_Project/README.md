Customer Churn Prediction – ML & Data Analytics Project
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the service) using a Machine Learning model.
It also provides data analytics insights through a dashboard and allows users to upload CSV files to get predictions via a web app.

The system integrates:

Machine Learning model for churn prediction

Streamlit web application for user interaction

Power BI dashboard for data visualization and analytics

🎯 Objectives

Predict customer churn using ML algorithms

Provide probability of churn for each customer

Enable CSV upload for real-time predictions

Visualize churn insights using Power BI

🚀 Features

Upload customer dataset (CSV)

View dataset preview

Predict churn (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Display churn probability
